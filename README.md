# mcl
mcl is a simple minecraft launcher that uses dmenu and minecraft-launcher-cmd

## installation
```
$ git clone https://git.kocotian.pl/mcl
$ cd mcl

be sure that you installed dmenu (tools.suckless.org/dmenu) and minecraft-launcher-cmd (package in AUR / gitlab.com/JakobDev/minecraft-launcher-cmd)

## configuration
put your email and password in *~/.config/mcl/passwd*

### how to create profiles?
open your profile file *(by default ~/.config/mcl/profiles)*, you will have a few commented profiles that you can edit, copy, uncomment, etc.
consult manpage for more info
